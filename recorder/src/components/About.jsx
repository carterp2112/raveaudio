      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>Our story begins on a quiet Monday, when Carter was thinking about a project to make using React. Remembering that he had made an audio recorder for browsers in the past, Carter decided that it would be good to try and make a version using react, giving birth to this website.</p>
      <br /><h1>What Does This Website Do?</h1>
      <p>As the cards above say, it can record audio straight from your browser, just add a permissions! It also will allow you to download your audio for your safekeeping, as well as do a little light editing with some of our voice-changer features.</p>
